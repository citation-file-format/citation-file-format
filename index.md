title: Citation File Format (CFF)  
subtitle: "Specification - Version 1.0.0-beta"
author: Stephan Druskat (mail@sdruskat.net)
abstract: 
  The *Citation File Format* (*CFF*) is a human- *and* machine-readable format for citation files, which provide references to (research and scientific) software to be used for citation and other types of reference.
  The format aims to support all use cases for software citation described in {% cite principles %}.
  CFF is serialized in [YAML](http://yaml.org) [1.2](http://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html), and is therefore Unicode-based and cross-language (in terms of both natural language scripts and programming languages).
  This specification, together with the Unicode standard for characters, aims to provide all the information necessary to understand CFF, and to use (i.e., write) and re-use (i.e., read, validate, convert from) it.
  The specification is maintained openly at <https://github.com/sdruskat/citation-file-format>.

# Introduction

## Status of this document

This document reflects the first version of the *Citation File Format* (CFF).
CFF has been developed in the context of the [*Workshop on Sustainable Software
for Science: Practice and Experiences
(WSSSPE5.1)*](http://wssspe.researchcomputing.org.uk/wssspe5-1/), which was held
on 6 September 2017 in Manchester, UK. More specifically, the constraints for
CFF has been developed in the discusion and speed blogging group "Development
and implementation of a standard format for CITATION files", whose members were
Stephan Druskat (Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, Germany), Neil Chue Hong
(Software Sustainability Institute, University of Edinburgh, UK), Raniere Silva
(Software Sustainability Institute, University of Manchester, UK), Radovan Bast
(University of Tromsø, Norway), Andrew Rowley (University of Manchester, UK),
and Alexander Konovalov (University of St. Andrews, UK).

CFF Version 1.0 has been developed by Stephan Druskat with contributions from
the following.

- Radovan Bast ([\@bast](https://github.com/bast)): Reporter
- Raniere Silva ([\@rgaiacs](https://github.com/rgaiacs)): Reporter

CFF has been developed to provide the first iteration of a format for `CITATION`
files which could be recommended to readers of the blog post which has been
produced by the group during the workshop and shortly after, and which will be
published on the [blog page](https://www.software.ac.uk/blog) of the [Software
Sustainability Institute](https://www.software.ac.uk/).

## Rationale

> The rationale for a standardized, machine- and human-readable format for
`CITATION` files is discussed in {% cite standardized-citation-files %}. CFF has
been developed to support all use cases for the citation of software, as
discussed in {% cite principles %}, and thus promote attribution and credit for
software in general, and research software in particular.

In a blog post {% cite citation-files %}, Robin Wilson has introduced `CITATION`
files as a means to make citation information for software easily accessible.
This accessibility is important, because in order to receive deserved credit for
research software in the academic system - where credit is still mainly measured
based on citations -, the citation information for software must be made
visible; Authors will only cite software if the citation information is readily
available, as there is no standard, easily deducible way (yet) to cite software,
such as there is for journals for example.

Some have followed the advice, and have uploaded `CITATION` (or `CITATION.md`,
or `CITATION.txt`) files to the root of the source code repository holding their
software. While this practice has made for a good start, plain text,
unstandardized `CITATION` files are not machine-readable, and machine-
readability is a precondition for re-use of the citation information in
different contexts which could further support a fair distribution of credit for
research software.

## Goals

The goal of CFF is to provide an all-purpose citation format (similar to BibTeX
or RIS), and specifically provide optimized means of citation for software via
the provision of software-specific reference keys and types, e.g., a dedicated
type for source code and one for executables, and a reference key for versions.

The ultimate goal of CFF as a project is comprehensive uptake and re-use of the
format by Research Software Engineers and software developers as well as by
vendors and services, such as software repositories, reference managers, etc.,
in order to boost the visibility of citation information for research software,
and empower the fair distribution of credit for software development,
maintenance, etc., in academia.

## Concepts

For users of other reference formats, such as BibTeX or RIS, it is important to
note that in CFF, all available keys can be used for all Work Types. CFF leaves
reasonability of use with format users and providers of tooling, such as
conversion software for CFF and other formats. In other words, the use of keys
should follow common sense. If not, it will confuse the user of the `CITATION`
file, and some of the information will probably be lost in re-use scenarios such
as conversion or display. If you feel that CFF does not offer a solution for
your specific use case, please consider contributing to the format as described
in section [Contributions].

Furthermore please note that if a section of a work is referenced, this is not
supported by a dedicated Work Type. Instead, the `section` key in the parent
type (i.e., `book` for a section of a book, etc.) should be used.

# Format

CFF `CITATION` files must be named `CITATION.cff`.

CFF is implemented in YAML 1.2, as the language provides optimal human-
readability and the required core data types.

## File structure

CFF `CITATION` files are made up of

- exactly one message containing instructions on how to cite the software which the file is associated with;
- one or more works, containing at least `type`, `author`, and `title` information.

For full examples, please see section [Examples].

Start the file with a message object:

```yaml

- message: If you use this software, please cite the works below.
```

Add a work object:

```yaml

- message: If you use this software, please cite the works below.
- type: software-code
  authors:
    - name: Druskat::Stephan
      orcid: 0000-0003-4925-7248
  title: Stephan's Research Software
  doi: 10043/zenodo.1234
```

Complete the work object with the respective information, and perhaps add more work objects.

```yaml

- message: If you use this software, please cite the works below.
- type: software-code

    - name: Druskat::Stephan

## Formatting

CFF is YAML 1.2, so it follows the formatting rules of YAML 1.2, of which one of
the most important ones is that the colon (`:`) after a key should always be
followed by a whitespace.

## Entities

Entity objects can represent different types of entities, e.g., a person,
publishing company, or conference. In CFF, they are realized as collections with
a defined set of keys. Only the key `name` is mandatory. When the entity
represents a person, the `name` key must be formatted following the pattern
`"{last names} :: {first names} {middle names}"`. This pattern is used to parse
names correctly, and implicitly disambiguate person entities from other
entities. Therefore, if a non-person entity name follows this pattern, it must
be given as `{first part of the name} \:: {second part of the name}`.

Note that the whitespaces preceding and following the separators (`::`, `\::`)
are optional.

### Roles

An entity representing a person can be assigned a role for the purposes of
specifying authorship status, e.g., to distinguish main authors of a software
from contributors who have provided a small patch. The defined roles are:


  Key
  -------------------------------------------------------------
  **administrator** (e.g., of a software system)
  **artist**
  **assignee** (e.g., of a patent)
  **main-author**
  **benchmarker** (e.g., of a software)
  **cartographer**
  **composer**
  **contributor**
  **creator**
  **designer**
  **director** (e.g., of a movie)
  **editor** (e.g., of an edited book/edition)
  **evangelist** (e.g., for a software)
  **insitution** (e.g., issuing a standard)
  **inventor**
  **manager** (e.g., of a software project)

provides the following defined statuses for works.

  Status (String)    Description
  ------------------ -----------------------------
  **in-preparation**     A work in preparation, e.g., a manuscript
  **abstract**           The abstract of a work

  Table: Defined statuses for works

## Programming languages

CFF knows the following programming language keys. If a language is not
included, please use the key `other` with a lower-case, hyphenated string
argument, and do not include the version of the programming language used, e.g.,
`other=my-fancy-language`. Additionally, please create an issue on the [GitHub
repository for CFF](https://github.com/sdruskat/citation-file-
format/issues/new), asking to include the programming language in the list.

  Table: List of programming language names available in CFF. Table based on the languages available on GitHub (via <https://github.com/github/linguist/blob/master/lib/linguist/languages.yml>, MIT license, Copyright (c) 2017 GitHub, Inc.).

## Schema

It is planned to provide a PyKwalify schema for the validation of CFF files.
This is work in progress.

## Examples

### A software with a DOI

Note that {% cite principles -l 12 %} recommends

> [...] the use of DOIs as the unique identifier due to their common usage and
acceptance, particularly as they are the standard for other digital products
such as publications.

Furthermore, DOIs should point to a "unique, specific software version" {% cite
principles -l 12 %}. Also it is recommended {% cite principles -l 13 %} that:

> the [DOI] should resolve to a persistent landing page that contains metadata and a link to the software itself, rather than directly to the source code files, repository, or executable.

Therefore, a minimal `CITATION.cff` file in such a case would look similar to
the following.

```yaml

### A software without a DOI

For software without a DOI, it is recommended that "the metadata should still
provide information on how to access the specific software, but this may be a
company’s product number or a link to a website that allows the software be
purchased." {% cite principles -l 13 %}. Furthermore, "if the version number and
release date are not available, the download date can be used. Similarly, the
contact name/email is an alternative to the location/repository." {% cite
principles -l 7 %}

Hence, for a closed source software without a DOI for which the version number
and release date cannot be determined, a `CITATION.cff` file could look like
this.

```yaml

- message: If you dare to use this commercial, closed-source, unversioned software in your research, please at least cite it as below.

# Infrastructure

It is planned to provide further infrastructure (e.g., software packages), to
support the following use cases for CFF:

- Creating CFF `CITATION` files
- Reading CFF `CITATION` files
- Validating CFF `CITATION` files
- Converting CFF `CITATION` files

For some use cases in software, cf. https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2014-07-30
