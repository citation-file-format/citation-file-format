# Introduction

**Thank you** for considering to contribute to CFF!

**Please follow these guidelines.** Their purpose is to make both contributing and accepting contributions easier for all parties involved.

There are many **ways to contribute**, e.g.:

- Write blog posts, tutorials, etc. about CFF
- Review any and all parts of the format and its infrastructure: specifications, libraries, documentation, etc., and submit bug reports, feature requests, suggestions and similar, respectively
- Language polish any prose output, including the specifications
- Create a new, better version of the specifications
- Create new infrastructure, e.g., improve automated tests or develop a library to read CFF files in a new programming language

Please do not use the issue tracker of any 
[CFF repository](https://github.com/citation-file-format/citation-file-format/blob/master/README.md#repositories) 
for user support questions. Instead, if the documentation is not sufficient to
help you, please submit an issue against the respective repository, detailing
what in the documentation is missing for you to resolve your issue.

# Ground Rules

Your contribution to CFF is valued, and it should be an enjoyable experience.
To ensure this, there is the CFF 
[Code of Conduct](https://github.com/citation-file-format/citation-file-format/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), which you are required to follow.

Apart from how you communicate with others, some CFF projects may have specific
technical responsibilities, which are outlined in the project's own guidelines
for contributing. If you cannot find them, please submit an issue in the
respective repository, asking for the addition of a `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

# Your First Contribution

If you are unsure where to begin contributing to CFF, you can start by reviewing
the current specifications, as these are the core of CFF. Additionally, look
through the 
[open issues in this repository](https://github.com/citation-file-format/citation-file-format/issues), 
and see if you can identify one that you would like to work on.

If you have never contributed to an open source project, you may find this tutorial helpful:
[How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://app.egghead.io/playlists/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

# Getting started

As of now, there is no Contributor License Agreement for CFF, although perhaps
there should be one.

Please **fork the repository** you want to contribute to, and then
**make the changes in your fork**. Once you are happy and think that
your changes should be included in the code base of the project, 
please **note the code of conduct** and **send a pull request**. 

There is a collection of test `.cff` files in the `test` directory.
It may be a good idea to add a test if you modify the specification,
or if you discover a part of the specification which is not covered
by tests. If you modify anything in the `test` directory, it is
advised to run these tests locally on your computer prior to submitting
a pull request. However, if that's not possible, you still can submit
the pull request and later check the status of the tests for your
pull requests on GitHub. Please see `test/README.md` file for further
details about tests and instructions how to run them locally.

# How to submit an issue

If you find a security vulnerability anywhere, do NOT open an issue. Email *cff-
security /at\ sdruskat \dot/ net* instead.

Every project/repository should have its own issue template, so that when
you create a new issue, you can simply fill it in and everything that is
needed to work on your issue will be there.

If no issue template exists, please create an issue for that instead,
asking for the addition of an issue template.
