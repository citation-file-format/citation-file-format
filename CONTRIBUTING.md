# Introduction

**Thank you** for considering to contribute to CFF!

**Please follow these guidelines.** Their purpose is to make both contributing and accepting contributions easier for all parties involved.

There are many **ways to contribute**, e.g.:

- Write blog posts, tutorials, etc. about CFF
- Review any and all parts of the format and its infrastructure: specifications, libraries, documentation, etc., and submit bug reports, feature requests, suggestions and similar, respectively
- Language polish any prose output, including the specifications
- Create a new, better version of the specifications

Please do not use the issue tracker of any 
[CFF repository](https://github.com/citation-file-format/citation-file-format/blob/master/README.md#repositories) 
for user support questions. Instead, if the documentation is not sufficient to
help you, please submit an issue against the respective repository, detailing
what in the documentation is missing for you to resolve your issue.

Apart from how you communicate with others, some CFF projects may have specific
technical responsibilities, which are outlined in the project's own guidelines
for contributing. If you cannot find them, please submit an issue in the

# How to submit an issue

If you find a security vulnerability anywhere, do NOT open an issue. Email *cff-

Every project/repository should have its own issue template, so that when
you create a new issue, you can simply fill it in and everything that is
needed to work on your issue will be there.

If no issue template exists, please create an issue for that instead,
asking for the addition of an issue template.
