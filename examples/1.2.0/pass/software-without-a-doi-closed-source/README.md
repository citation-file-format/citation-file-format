For software without a DOI, it is recommended that "the metadata should still
provide information on how to access the specific software, but this may be a
companyâ€™s product number or a link to a website that allows the software be
purchased." [Smith et al., 2016](https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj-cs.86), p. 13. Furthermore, "if the version number and
release date are not available, the download date can be used. Similarly, the
contact name/email is an alternative to the location/repository."
([Smith et al., 2016](https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj-cs.86), p. 7).

Hence, for closed-source software without a DOI for which the version number
and release date cannot be determined, a `CITATION.cff` file could look like
[./CITATION.cff](./CITATION.cff).
