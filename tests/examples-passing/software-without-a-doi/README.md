We recognize that there are certain situations where it may not be possible to
follow the recommended best-practice. For example, if (1) the software authors
did not register a DOI and/or release a specific version, or (2) the version of
the software used does not match what is available to cite. In those cases,
falling back on a combination of the repository URL and version number/commit
hash would be an appropriate way to cite the software used ([Smith et al., 2016](https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj-cs.86), p. 12).
