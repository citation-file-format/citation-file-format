# Software with a DOI

Note that [Smith et al., 2016](https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj-cs.86), p. 12 recommend

> [...] the use of DOIs as the unique identifier due to their common usage and
acceptance, particularly as they are the standard for other digital products
such as publications.

Furthermore, DOIs should point to a "unique, specific software version"
([Smith et al., 2016](https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj-cs.86), p. 12). Also it is recommended ([Smith et al., 2016](https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj-cs.86), p. 13) that:

> the [DOI] should resolve to a persistent landing page that contains metadata
and a link to the software itself, rather than directly to the source code files,
repository, or executable.

Therefore, a minimal `CITATION.cff` file in such a case would look similar to [CITATION.cff](CITATION.cff).
