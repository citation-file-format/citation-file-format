# Developer notes

## Testing

The directories `tests/examples-failing` and `tests/examples-passing` contain a collection of `CITATION.cff` files used for
testing. As their names suggest, `tests/examples-failing` contains examples of `CITATION.cff` files that should not pass
validation, whereas `tests/examples-passing` contains files that should. In addition to these, we also extract CFF snippets from
`schema-guide.md` and check that they are valid.

Testing can be done using the regular `pytest` way. First, install the required dependencies used in testing:

```shell
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then run the tests with:

```shell
pytest tests/ -v
```

During the test, `CITATION.cff` files are validated against the schema from `schema.json` using `jsonschema`. You should expect
to see output similar to this:

```

tests/test_cff_files.py::test[pass:entity-author-with-affiliation] PASSED [  0%]

... some output omitted...

```

Followed by the output from testing the snippets:

```

## Publishing

The following is a non-exhaustive todo list when preparing a new release of the Citation File Format.

1. Verify that all contributors who want to be acknowledged have been included as `contributors` in `CITATION.cff`
2. Verify that the version strings are updated throughout the code base. Be careful with batch-changing the version string
   (e.g. with `sed`), because maybe not all version strings should be bumped, it may depend on context.
3. Verify that the tests pass on a fresh download & venv & install & pytest
4. Manually trigger the link checker
5. Manually trigger other workflows if relevant
