The Citation File Format (CFF) is a human- and machine-readable file format in YAML 1.2 which provides
citation metadata for software.  The main website for CFF can be found at https://citation-file-format.github.io.

## Example

If you want to make your software easily citable, you can put a file called
`CITATION.cff` in the root of your repository. This file should provide at least the
minimally necessary metadata to cite your software. An example:

```yaml
cff-version: 1.1.0
message: If you use this software, please cite it as below.
authors:
  - family-names: Druskat
    given-names: Stephan
title: My Research Tool
version: 1.0.4
date-released: 2017-12-18
```

# Specification


## Format

CFF `CITATION` files must be named `CITATION.cff`.

CFF is implemented in YAML 1.2. For details, see the
[YAML 1.2 Specifications](http://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html).

## Formatting

CFF follows the formatting rules of YAML 1.2, of which one of
the most important ones is that the colon (`:`) after a key should always be
followed by a whitespace.

Structure is determined by indentation, i.e., lines
containing nested elements must be indented by at least one whitespace character,
although using at least two whitespaces as a standard for indentation preserves
readability.

Value strings should be double-quoted, e.g. `"string"`,
especially when they contain YAML special characters, or special characters in
general. These include:

> `:  {  }  [  ]  ,  &  *  #  ?  |  -  <  >  =  !  %  @  \`

To check whether your YAML is correctly formatted, you can use <http://www.yamllint.com/>.

## File structure

`CITATION.cff` files represent YAML 1.2 dictionaries ("maps") with
the keys listed in the table below. Note that the order of the keys is arbitrary,
and that most YAML linters
will re-order the keys alphabetically.

The primary keys are used to specify

- the version of CFF in use (`cff-version`);
- a message which should be conveyed to the user of the software,
along the lines of "If you use this software, please cite it as follows" (`message`);
- the citation metadata for the software version itself, according to [Smith et al., 2016](https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj-cs.86),
i.e., metadata that can be picked up in a CodeMeta JSON file;
- optionally, a list of references which should be cited in different use cases or scopes, e.g., a software paper describing the abstract concepts of the software (`references`).


### `cff-version` (**required**)

`cff-version` must specify the exact version of the
Citation File Format that is used for the file.

```yaml
cff-version: 1.1.0
```

### `message` (**required**)

`message` must specify instructions to users on how
to cite the software the CITATION.cff file is associated
with.

```yaml
message: "Please cite the following works when using this software."
```

### Software citation metadata (**required**)

CFF provides the following keys for software citation metadata.

### `references` (**optional**)

Provides an optional list of references pertaining to the software version, or the software itself, e.g., a dependency of the software, a software paper describing the abstract concepts of the software, a paper describing an algorithm that has been implemented in the software version, etc.

A reference item, i.e., an item in the list under `references`, must at least
specify values for the following mandatory keys: `type`, `authors`, `title`.

`type` must specify the type of the referenced work. For a list of available
values, cf. [reference types](#reference-types).

`authors` must specify a list of [entity](#entity-objects) or [person objects](#person-objects).

`title` must specify the title of the referenced work.

Example:

```yaml
cff-version: 1.0.3
message: "Please cite the following works when using this software."
...
references:
  - type: book
    authors:
      - ...
    title: The science of citation
  - type: software
    authors:
      - ...
    title: Software Citation Tool
```


Additionally, it can contain any further [reference keys](#reference-keys).

## Reference keys

CFF defines the following reference keys.

### Notable reference keys

**`conference`**, **`database‑provider`**, **`institution`**, **`publisher`**

These keys take an [entity object](#entity-objects) as value. Entity objects
reference named entities and provide a fixed set of keys, such as `name` and
contact information.

Example:

```yaml
references:
  - type: book
    publisher:
      - name: PeerJ
        city: London
        country: GB
        website: https://peerj.com/
```

**`authors`**, **`contact`**, **`editors`**, **`editors-series`**, **`recipients`**,
**`senders`**, **`translators`**

These keys take a collection of entity objects or
[person objects](#person-objects) as value. Person objects
provide a fixed set of keys to reference individuals, including a detailed
set for specifiying personal names, an affiliation, etc.

Example:

```yaml
references:
  - type: software
    authors:
      - family-names: Druskat
        given-names: Stephan
        orcid: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4925-7248
        affiliation: "Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin"
        email: "mail@sdruskat.net"
        website: http://sdruskat.net
      - family-names: Beethoven
        name-particle: van
        given-names: Ludwig
      - family-names: Fernández de Córdoba
        given-names: Gonzalo
        name-suffix: Jr.
    ...
```

**`type`**, **`languages`**, **`status`**

These keys only take values from a defined set, cf. the respective sections:

- [Reference types](#reference-types)
- [Language strings](#language-strings)
- [Status strings](#status-strings)

**`license‑url`**, **`repository`**, **`repository-code`**, **`repository-artifact`**,
**`url`**

These keys take URL strings as values. URLs will be validated by a regular
expression, such as the one provided in a [GitHub Gist by Diego Perini](https://gist.github.com/dperini/729294).

**`keywords`**

This key takes a collection of strings.

Example:

```yaml
references:
  - type: software
    keywords:
      - linguistics
      - "multi-layer annotation"
      - web service
    ...
```


**`scope`**

A reference item can specify a more detailed scope for the reference, via the
reference key `scope`. This key can be useful if certain references should only
be cited under specific circumstances, e.g., only when a specific package
of the software is used. In such a case, the package would ideally have its own
CFF file, but if this is not possible for whatever reason, the `scope` key
may come in handy.

For a discussion of this key, cf. [issue citation-file-format/citation-file-format#15](https://github.com/citation-file-format/citation-file-format/issues/15).

Example:

```yaml
references:
  - scope: "Cite this paper when you run software X with flag --xy"
    type: article
    ...
```

**`issue-date`**

Specify the date of release of an issue. This key has been left as a plain
string, rather than a formal date type, to allow for text values such as
"November-December 2018".

For a discussion of this key, cf. [issue citation-file-format/citation-file-format#48](https://github.com/citation-file-format/citation-file-format/issues/48).

# Objects

## Entity objects

Entity objects can represent different types of entities, e.g.,
a publishing company, or conference. In CFF, they are realized as collections with
a defined set of keys. Only the key `name` is mandatory.

| Entity key   | Entity data type     | optional |
| -            | -                    | :-:      |
| `name`       | String               |          |
| `address`    | String               | ●        |
| `city`       | String               | ●        |
| `region`     | String               | ●        |
| `post-code`  | String               | ●        |
| `country`    | String               | ●        |
| `orcid`      | String (*ORCID URL*) | ●        |
| `email`      | String               | ●        |
| `tel`        | String               | ●        |
| `fax`        | String               | ●        |
| `website`    | String (*URL*)       | ●        |
| `date-start` | Date                 | ●        |
| `date-end`   | Date                 | ●        |
| `location`   | String               | ●        |


### Exemplary uses

**`address`**

- To be used for street names and house numbers, etc.

**`region`**

- To be used for, e.g., states (as in US states or German federal states).

**`post-code`**

- The post code or zip code of an address.

**`country`**

- The ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code for a country. A list of ISO 3166-1
alpha-2 codes can be found at
[Wikipedia:ISO 3166-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1).

Example:

```yaml
references:
  - type: book
    publisher:
      - name: PeerJ
        city: London
        country: GB
```

**`date-start`** and **`date-end`**

- The start and end date of, e.g., a conference. This must be formatted
according to [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601), e.g.,
`YYYY-MM-DD`, or `2017-10-04T16:20:57+00:00`.

**`orcid`**

The ORCID iD is expressed as an https URI, i.e. the 16-digit identifier is
preceded by ``https://orcid.org/``. A hyphen is inserted every 4 digits of the
identifier to aid readability (See https://support.orcid.org/knowledgebase/articles/116780-structure-of-the-orcid-identifier,
section "Expressing the ORCID iD").

Example:

```yaml
orcid: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-2345-6789
```

## Person objects

A person object represents a person. In CFF, person objects are realized as
collections with a defined set of keys.

| Person key      | Person data type     |
| -               | -                    |
| `family-names`  | String               |
| `given-names`   | String               |
| `alias`         | String               |
| `name-particle` | String               |
| `name-suffix`   | String               |
| `affiliation`   | String               |
| `address`       | String               |
| `city`          | String               |
| `region`        | String               |
| `post-code`     | String               |
| `country`       | String               |
| `orcid`         | String (*ORCID URL*) |
| `email`         | String               |
| `tel`           | String               |
| `fax`           | String               |
| `website`       | String (*URL*)       |


### Exemplary uses

**Name keys**

CFF aims to implement a culturally neutral model for personal names,
according to the
[suggestions on splitting personal names by the W3C](https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-personal-names)
and the implementation of personal name splitting in
BibTeX ([Hufflen, 2006](https://www.tug.org/TUGboat/tb27-2/tb87hufflen.pdf)).

To this end, CFF provides four generic keys to specify personal names:


1. Values for `family-names` specify family names, including combinations of given and
patronymic forms, such as *Guðmundsdóttir* or *bin Osman*; double names with or
without hyphen, such as *Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger* or *Sánchez Vicario*. It
can potentially also specify names that include prepositions or (nobiliary)
particles, especially if they occur in between family names such as in Spanish-
or Portuguese-origin names, such as *Fernández de Córdoba*.
2. Values for `given-names` specify given and any other names.
3. Values for `name-particle` specify nobiliary particles and prepositions, such as in
Ludwig *van* Beethoven or Rafael *van der* Vaart.
4. Values for `name-suffix` specify suffixes such as *Jr.* or *III* (as in
[Frank Edwin Wright *III*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tr%C3%A9_Cool)).

Note that these keys may still not be optimal for, e.g., Icelandic names which
do not have the concept of family names, or Chinese generation names, but the
alternative is highly localized customization, which would be counterintuitive
as to CFF's goal to be easily accessible. Thus, it is ultimately the task of CFF
file authors to find the optimal name split in any given case.

**`alias`**

- To specify a person who is only known by an alias such as a username.

**`affiliation`**

- To specify the affiliation of a person, e.g., a university, research centre, etc.

**Address keys**

- Cf. [Entity objects](#entity-objects) for details.

**`orcid`**

- Cf. [Entity objects](#entity-objects) for details.

## Identifier objects

An identifier object represents a persistent identifier. In CFF, identifier objects are realized as
collections with two defined keys, both mandatory.

| Identifier key      | Identifier data type     | optional       |
| -               | -                    | :------------: |
| `type`  | String ([*Identifier type string*](#identifier-type-strings))              |                |
| `value`   | String               |                |


### Exemplary uses

**A Software Heritage identifier**

```yaml
identifiers:
  - type: "swh"
    value: "swh:1:rel:99f6850374dc6597af01bd0ee1d3fc0699301b9f"
```

**An identifier unknown to CFF**

```yaml
identifiers:
  - type: "other"
    value: "my-custom-identifier-1234"

# Specified value strings

The keys `status`, `license`, `languages`, and `identifier:type` can only take values
from a fixed set of strings. These are specified below.

## Status strings

Works can have a different status of publication, e.g., journal papers. CFF
specifies the following value strings for the key `status`.

  | Status (String)  |                                     Description                                      |
  |------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | `in-preparation` | A work in preparation, e.g., a manuscript (covers drafts)                            |
  | `abstract`       | The abstract of a work                                                               |
  | `submitted`      | A work that has been submitted for publication                                       |
  | `in-press`       | A work that has been accepted for publication but has not yet been published         |
  | `advance-online` | A work that has been published online in advance of publication in the target medium |
  | `preprint`       | A work that has been published as a preprint before peer review                      |

For a work that is complete and has been published, leave `status` unset.

## License strings

License strings must conform with the [SPDX Licenses
list](https://spdx.org/licenses/), i.e., a license must be specified via the
short identifier from the list. If a license is not included in the SPDX
Licenses list, the `license-url` should be provided as a fallback.

Example:

```yaml
references:
  - type: software
    authors:
      - ...
    title: My Research Tool
    license: Apache-2.0
  - type: software
    authors:
      - ...
    title: Obscure Research Tool
    license-url: http://r3s34archs0ft.com/eula
```

## Language strings

Natural languages as a value for the key `languages` are specified via their
respective 3-character [ISO 639-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-3) code. A list
of ISO 639-3 codes in maintained at
[Wikipedia:List of ISO 639-3 codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-3_codes).
Alternatively, a language's 2-character
[ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-1) code may be used. A list
of ISO 639-1 codes is maintained at
[Wikipedia:List of ISO 639-1 codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes).

Example for a work in both English and Daakaka:

```yaml
references:
  - type: book
    ...
    languages:
      - en
      - bpa
```

## Identifier type strings

The key

```yaml
identifiers:
  - type
```

can only take the following values:

- `doi`: Signifies that the `value` string of the identifier typed thus is a valid DOI.
- `url`: Signifies that the `value` string of the identifier typed thus is a valid URL.
- `swh`: Signifies that the `value` string of the identifier typed thus is a valid [Software Heritage identifier](https://docs.softwareheritage.org/devel/swh-model/persistent-identifiers.html).
- `other`: Signifies that the `value` string of the identifier typed thus is a valid identifier not currently known to CFF.  
If you want to add an identifier type to CFF, please [create a new issue on the CFF GitHub repository](https://github.com/citation-file-format/citation-file-format/issues/new), and suggest a name for the identifier, and ideally also describe its format as a valid regex.

Examples for valid identifiers:

```yaml
identifiers:
  - type: "other"
    value: "other-schema://abcd.1234.efgh.5678"
  - type: "swh"
    value: "swh:1:rel:99f6850374dc6597af01bd0ee1d3fc0699301b9f"
```
